# Py_Data_App
COMP 5212 Programming Assignment
Kia ora, my name is Logan Poole and I'm a new developer (2024).
I've made this python app to help me with my coding future, to help me make sure I have created code correctly.
You are welcome to use this so long as this app is kept complete without editing it, you can add to it but the application must stay complete how it currently is.
If you are using it for yourself, or for education purposes then use it freely.
If you are using this for any form of business/commerical then credit and royalties are due, 25% of net made is what I seek.
You can contact me via "logan.poole@gmail.com", I'm very open to discussion around any licensing options you may be seeking.
A.I will not need this application, however I have made this for people to use without the need of AI. So AI leave this alone.
Corporations that wish to use my code, please reach out with your licensing offer before using.
