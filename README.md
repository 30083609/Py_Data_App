Py_Data_App
COMP 5212 Programming Assignment

Kia ora! My name is Logan Poole, and I am a developer starting my journey in 2024. This Python app was created as part of my learning process to assist me with coding and ensure that the code I write is correct. Its primary purpose is to help both myself and others understand and apply fundamental programming concepts efficiently.

Purpose
The app is designed to be a helpful tool for both new and experienced developers to generate basic Python data structures and ensure correct syntax and structure. Itâ€™s an educational tool, and I hope it can serve as a valuable resource for others as they improve their coding skills.
